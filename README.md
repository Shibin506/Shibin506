<h1 align="center">Hi there, I'm Shibin Biji Thomas 👋</h1>


## 🚀 About Me

👨‍💻 Hey there! I'm Shibin, a curious builder who loves playing with data, code, and cloud platforms.

Detail-oriented software engineer pursuing MS in Applied Data Intelligence at San Jose State University, with a strong focus on
Full Stack development, distributed systems, and cloud-native architectures. 
Experienced in designing and optimizing scalable, high concurrency microservices and event-driven workflows, with an emphasis on system reliability and performance. 
I design and build scalable microservices and event-driven workflows with an eye on reliability, latency, and throughput.
Comfortable across Python, Java, and C++, plus FastAPI/Flask and Node.js. Hands-on with cloud-native patterns and CI/CD, and I like turning performance bottlenecks into measurable wins.
I am eager to join a team that values innovation, collaboration, and diversity, and where I can contribute to the development and improvement of data-driven products and services.
